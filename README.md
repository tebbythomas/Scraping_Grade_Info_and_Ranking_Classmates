# Python Selenium Script to login to every student's portal, scrape all the subject marks and cgpas and finally rank all the students in the class

<p>
This was a fun program I worked on while in college to retrieve all my classmates' grades and also rank everyone in the batch.
<br />
The script involved using Selenium to login to each student's account, then access the academic results of each semester, scrape all the grade info and finally store it in a file.
<br />
This info was later used to rank all the students by their cgpas.
